# C2Matrix-Automation

## What is project?

The project is based on the C2 Matrix by Jorge Jorge Orchilles, Bryson Bort and Adam Mashinchi, which is a sensational project that helps you pinpoint the best C2 for your needs.

Based on this project, Miter Att&ck and my Cracking The Perimeter Framework, I developed this script to automate the installation of a command and control server. I plan to take this one step further by innovating with attack vectors that can be customized for attacks within your favorite C2.


My Cracking The Perimeter framework brings C2 as an essential solution to help test the effectiveness of security controls and manage your tests. In addition to performing Adversary Emulation and having as a partner structure for the CTP tools such as Exploit-Pack.


So as the start of a framework that can be used by everyone and applied within an organization, I started some automation projects.
